After organizing multiple notes together as my knowledge grew, I found myself developing a system to organize them based on depth. This system categorizes my permanent notes into three distinct groups, each with its own title format and depth of content. By using these naming conventions, I would be able to tell which type of note I’m about to click on just by a first glance.

1. **Foundational**: `group-one`
2. **Practical**: `group two`
3. **Formal**: `Group Three`

This system isn’t something I strictly follow, instead using it as a guideline to help me define the type of note I’m trying to write.

## Foundational

- Serve as *building blocks* for more complex ideas
- Capture essential information
- Define key terms and concepts
- Summarize fundamental theories or models
- Create a network of interconnected basic ideas

Notes in this first category use the [[kebab-case]] naming convention. These notes comprise of core concepts, definitions, and fundamental principals.

> [!example]- title-examples
> - `operating-systems`
> - `kernel`
> - `open-systems-interconnection-model`
> - `bus-topology`

## Practical

- Compile practical references and cheat sheets
- Document frequently used commands or procedures
- Document solutions and methods
- Applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios
- Keep track of useful resources or tools

Notes in this second category use a lowercase naming convention. These notes comprise of more specific, applied topics, and compiled reference materials.

> [!example]- title examples
> - `git command cheatsheet`
> - `blog ideas`
> - `operating systems list`
> - `setting up a network`

## Formal

- Write detailed tutorials or guides
- Develop or articulate ideas or insights
- Document personal experiences and case studies
- Analyze topics in depth
- Contribute to broader discussions

Notes in last category use a formal naming convention. This category is mostly comprehensive and reflective in nature, integrating information from various sources and my own experiences and insights.

> [!example]- Title Examples
> - `Vault title structure`
> - `Smart Note Taking`
> - `Effectively using GPT for Programming`
> - `How I use naming conventions to imrpove code readability`
