- ### Cloud Computing
- Types of cloud computing
	- Public clouds
	- Private clouds
	- Hybrid clouds
- ### Public cloud
- In Public Cloud the computer infrastructure is hosted by the cloud vendor at the vendor’s premises. The customer has no visibility and control over where the computer infrastructure is hosted.
- The computing infrastructure is shared between any organizations.
- Visibility: see who’s connected to the network
- ### Private cloud
- The computing infrastructure is dedicated to a particular organization and not shared with other organizations.
- Private clouds are more expensive and more secure when compared to public clouds.
- Used to be called your company network
- ### Hybrid cloud
- Organizations may host critical applications on Private Clouds and applications with relatively less security concerns on the Public Cloud
- The usage of both Private and Public clouds together is called Hybrid cloud. A related term is Cloud Bursting
- #### Cloud Bursting
- Organizations use their own infrastructure for normal usage, but access the cloud using services like Salesforce cloud computing for high/peak load requirements
- This ensures that a sudden increase in computing requirement is handled gracefully
- The public cloud brings **simplicity**, while private cloud means better **privacy**, but hybrid cloud combines the best of both worlds
- Best of both worlds: mobile and web-based access to corporate applications with high usability
- …
- What’s a personal cloud?
- ### Personal Cloud
- Is the individual’s collection of digital content, services and apps which are seamlessly accessible across any device
- The personal cloud is not a tangible entity, but rather the realization of *four* different types of experiences in which some users *s*tore, *s*ynchronize, *s*tream and *s*hare content on a contextual basis, moving from one platform, screen and location to another.
- Google drive, dropbox, etc.
- Three major components to personal cloud
	- **Data**
		- You decide which data to store, which to delete or modify
		- While your data is accessible over the network, nobody can access or use your data without your permission
		- You device which data you share with whom and when to revoke that privilege
	- **Apps**
		- You decide which apps from which vendors to use with your data
	- **Terms**
		- You define your own terms of service for anybody interacting with the data or the apps on your personal cloud
		- You can easily move your personal cloud to a competing hosting vendor if you so desire
- ### Services of the cloud
	- host – **Infrastructure as a service** “IaaS”
	- build – **Platform as a service** “PaaS”
	- consume – **Software as a service** “SaaS”
