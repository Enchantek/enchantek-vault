# Lecture Notes - CS441
### Tuesday, August 27th 2024

---

- Previous slides are posted on Canvas
- Important: **packet switching** and **circuit switching**
- Very important: **OSI Model**
	- Application (Data)
	- Presentation (Data)
	- Session (Data)
	- Transport (Segments)
	- Network (Packets)
	- Data Link (Frames)
	- Physical (Bits)
		- Above is a translation for what the OSI Model layers would do

		- Transport: why we compress: bandwidth, our valued real estate
* #### Understanding the big picture:
* ![[cs441 2024-08-27_1 1.jpg]]
- End-to-end: before we send the data to the other party, we make sure the other party is there
	- Same bandwidth
	- Valid point of communication
- Transport: check if there is any error, cuts into segments
- Cuts into packets
- Physical: 0s and 1s are transported, then on the “other side”, the reverse happens:
	- packets → segments → turns into message → shown to user
	- *We’ll cover standard packet size later*
- #### Application Layer
- **HTTP**
- ![[cs441 2024-08-27_2.jpg]]
- DoorDash uses Google Maps API
- Example protocol: Security Session 
- #### Session Layer
- Least respected in the whole list
- Like a wedding: wedding holder is thankless hero in holding the wedding, everybody busy thanking the bride/groom
	- Establishing and keeping alive communications link
	- Keeping communications secure
	- Identify session participants
	- Synchronizing dialogue between two nodes
		- Video chat, audio delay during talking
- 
- “Still there”
	- Possibility the connection will continue even if no communication is going on
- #### Transport Layer
- **TCP/IP**
	- Suite of protocols
	- NEEDED if you want to connect to the internet
	- Layer 4
	- IP: Layer 3 (Network)
- **MTU** (Maximum transmission unit)
- Accepts data from Session Layer, *they are trusting the Session Layer*
- Manage end-to-end data delivery
	- Like Amazon taking pictures of delivered package
	- Acknowledgement of delivery
	- Relying on “Still there → still there → still there”, aka async communication wouldn’t ever end
- Handle flow control
	- Warehouse dumping/loading area; if warehouse is accepting 10 trucks a day and there’s suddenly 15, there’s traffic, aka *overflow*
	- Stops intake unless processing is finished
- **Quality of Service** (QoS)
- Has a priority
	- Ex. CFO, CEO has a zoom meeting, thus, bandwidth of an intern watching YouTube is lowered
- Examples of TCP
	- Checksum
	- Segmentation
- #### Network Layer
- Routers/Switches
- **IP**
	- IPv4 - $2^{32}$
	- IPv6 - $2^{128}$
	- What is the difference? 
		- IPv4 is 32bit, IPv6 is 128bit.
	- What happened to IPv5?
		- Was created to be a protocol for streaming services
		- Don’t ever reuse the same term
		- Example with Operating Systems
			- Windows 7/8/10/11
			- We didn’t have Windows 9 because of Windows 95/98
			- Windows in the system is represented as 9x
- #### Data Link Layered
- Two sublayers
	- **Logical Link Control** (LLC) 
	- **MAC** (Media Access Control)
- #### Physical Layer
- *Copper transmission* medium
	- Signals issued as voltage
- *Fiber-optic cable*
	- Signals issued as light pulses
- *Wireless transmission medium*
	- Signals issued as electromagnetic signals
