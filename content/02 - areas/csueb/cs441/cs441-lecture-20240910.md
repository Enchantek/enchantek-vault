# Lecture Notes - CS441

- ### On the speakers
- You have to be able to explain yourself and why you did the things you did for your project.
- What’s your experience as a student: your projects.
- Colleges generally use the same textbooks, therefore what makes your experience different? Why should I hire you?
	- How you present yourself. How you solve the problem. Your experience. The foundations and classes you learned them from.
	- Soft skills, don’t be a jerk.
- A recruiter thinks of three things when considering you:
	- **Are you an asset? Are you valuable or a liability?**
	- **Are you a team player?**
	- **Can you fit with the company culture?**
	- Team or by yourself? Both.
- ### Multiplexing
- Why we have it
- Bandwidth is the most important part of computer networks
	- It’s like highways
	- Engineers have to optimize the highways
- Two ways to preserve the bandwidth
	- **Multiplexing**
	- **Compression**
- Highway analogy: compression is like the 2+ or more lane on the highway
- Multiplexing is when you’re trying to get on the highway, the red/green light before you enter
	- This is to ensure the highway runs smoothly, no traffic etc.
- #### Introduction
- Under simplest conditions, medium can carry only one signal at any moment in time
- Medium: wire, wireless, Bluetooth, etc.
- Two types of multiplexing:
	- **Frequency division multiplexing**
	- **Time division multiplexing**
	- (Also code division multiplexing)
- ### Frequency Division Multiplexing
- Assignment of *nonoverlapping* frequency ranges to each “user” or signal on a medium
- For satellite sending channels 1-n to earth:
	- Freq 0-10kHz
	- Channel 1: 0-0.9kHz
	- Channel 2: 1-1.9kHz
	- Thus, all signals are transmitted at the same time
- Each channel is assigned a set of frequencies and is transmitted over the medium
- .
- AM - Amplitude modulation
	- Change amplitude, depends on the power
- FM - Frequency modulation
- PM - Phase modulation
	- Used by the army, uses the start of the sine wave, more difficult
- XM - Satellite modulation
- ### FDM Continued
- Oldest multiplexing technique
- ### Time Division Multiplexing
- Sharing of the signal is accomplished by dividing available transmission time on a medium among users
- Satellite: 
	- Channel 1: 1s
	- Channel 2: 2s
	- Channel 3: 3s
- Divided into two subdivision basic forms:
	- Synchronous time division multiplexing
	- Statistical time division multiplexing
- Digital signaling is used exclusively
- #### Synchronous Time Division Multiplexing
- Original time division multiplexing
- Generated data faster than other devices
- Back to satellite, what if channel 2 is off the air? We waste the bandwidth in this case
	- This is where you see test photos (the colors, circles, bars) to fill in the space
- Buffering as a result of too much info being sent from one channel, the circle becomes slower
- #### Statistical Time Division Multiplexing
- This solved both above problems, it distributes the time, instead of 1s it’s 1.3s or 1.5s.
- A statistical multiplexor transmits the data from *active* workstations only.
- If workstation is not active, no space is wasted in the multiplexed system.
- ### Wavelength Division Multiplexing
- Multiplexes multiple data streams into a *single fiber-optic* line
- Different wavelength lasers (called lambdas) transmit the multiple signals
- ### Discrete Multitone
- A multiplexing technique commonly found in digital subscriber (DSL) systems
	- DSL not around anymore
- DMT combines hundreds of different signals, or subchannels, into one stream
- Interestingly, all of these subchannels *belong to a single user*, unlike the previous multiplexing techniques
- In your house, you have a parking spot
	- You don’t use it all the time, work, going out, etc.
	- What if you came home and someone else was parked in your spot
	- What the hell are you doing in my spot? It’s my spot.
	- You have the right to kick the person out of the spot
	- DSL the whole bandwidth connected to your house belongs to you
	- This is why companies keep calling to combine internet, landline, phone to one line, because of this
- ### Code Division Multiplexing
- What’s inside your cellphone
- Also known as code division multiple access
- An advanced technique that allows multiple devices to transmit on the same frequencies at the same time
- Each mobile device is assigned a unique 64-bit code
- We call cellphones cellphones because they are a part of a cell of transmission

- Fiber optics:
	- First mile problem, when ISP send electrical signals, they have to convert to light for fiber optics
	- Last mile problem, turning the light back into electrical signals
