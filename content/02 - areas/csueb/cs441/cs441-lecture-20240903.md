- 9/9 Monday: speakers
	- 11am - Google
	- 2pm - Nvidia
- #### Advantages of TCP/IP
	- *Open nature*
		- Costs nothing to use (free)
		- Open source
	- *Flexible*
		- Runs on virtually any platform
		- Connects dissimilar OS and devices
	- *Routable*
		- Transmission carry Network layer addressing info
		- Suitable for large networks
- Four layers
	- Application layer
	- Transport layer
	- Internet layer
	- Network access layer (or Link layer)
- Seven layers
	-  Application layer
		- Application
		- Presentation
		- Session
	- Transport layer
		- Transport
	- Internet layer
		- Network
	- Network access layer (or Link layer)
		- Data link
		- Physical
- #### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Transport layer protocol
- Provides reliable data delivery services
	- Connection-oriented subprotocol
		- You have to make the connection before sending data
	- Lasts longer
	- Like a reliable car, you trust it doesn’t stop or breaks down
- Establish connection before transmitting
- Uses sequences and checksums
- Provides flow control
	- Prevents overflow
- TCP segment format
	- Encapsulated by IP packet in Network layer
- Becomes IP packet’s “data”
- Increments acknowledgements by one
- #### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Transport layer protocol
- Provides unreliable data delivery services
	- Connectionless transport service
	- No assurance packets received in correct sequence
	- No guarantee packets received at all
	- No error checking, sequencing
	- Lacks sophistication
- More efficient than TCP
- Useful situations
	- Great volume of data transferred quickly
- -
- The difference between TCP and UDP is *handshake*
- #### IP (Internet Protocol)
- Network layer protocol
	- How and where data delivered, including:
- Data’s source and destination addresses
-
