- ### IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)
- Operates at Network layer of OSI model
- Manages multicasting on networks running IPv4
- Multicasting
	- Point-to-multipoint transmission method
	- One node sends data to a group of nodes
	- Used for Internet teleconferencing of videoconferencing
- ### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- Network layer protocol
- Used with IPv4
- Obtains MAC (physical) address of host or node
- Creates database that maps MAC to host’s IP address
- ### ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- Network layer protocol
	- Reports on data deliver success/failure
- Announces transmission failures to sender
	- Network congestion
	- Data fails to reach destination
	- Data discarded: **TTL** expired
- ICMP cannot correct errors
	- Provides critical network problem troubleshooting information
- ICMPv6 used with IPv6
- And in IPv4
- ### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- A friend in the world of IT departments
- *Automatically* assigns a device a unique IP address
	- Computer turned on/off, new IP address assigned
- Application layer protocol
- Reasons for implementing
	- Reduce time and planning for IP address management
	- Reduce potential for error in assigning IP addresses
	- Enable users to move workstations and printers
	- Make IP addressing transparent for mobile users

- ### Sockets and Ports
- **Process’s socket**
	- *Port number + host machine’s IP address*

- ### Other Protocols:
- #### FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- Used everywhere, texts, files, attachments etc.
- #### TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
- #### NTP (Network Time Protocol)
- #### PING (Packet Internet Groper)
- Ping
- ### Gateway
- A combination of networking hardware and software that connects two dissimilar kinds of networks. Gateways perform connectivity, session management, and data *translation*, so they must operate at multiple layers of the OSI model.
- Legacy = old
- Big companies won’t get rid of legacy systems
