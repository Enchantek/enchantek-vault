## Switching

- Logical network topology component
- Determines connection between nodes
- Two methods
	- Circuit switching (old one)
	- Packet switching (new one)

**Circuit switching**
- Connection established between two network nodes
- Like dedicated highway, you can't have a highway for every individual car
- Data follows same initial path selected by switch, monopolizes bandwidth while connected
- Wasted resource
- More popular for live audio, video transmission

**Packet switching**
- Most popular
- Breaks data into packets before transporting
	- Travel any network path to destination
	- Finds fastest circuit available at any instance
	- **Open Shortest Path First**
	- Don't need to follow each other
	- Don't need to arrive in sequence
	- Reassembled at destination
	- Requires speedy connections for live audio, video transmission
	- Highway analogy: take this exit, this road etc.

**OSI Model**
- Theoretical representation describing network communication between two nodes
- Hardware and software independent
- APSTNDP (All people seem to need data processing)
	- Application
		- Connects to network
	- Presentation
		- Three functions
		- Translate, encrypt, compress
	- Session
		- Making sure the other party is there
		- Ex. making sure email is valid, why send information if bandwidth is not there
		- Establishing the session, authenticating user
	- Transport
		- Delivery
	- Network
		- Router
		- Shortest path to the destination
	- Data link
		- **Network Interface Card**
		- Ethernet or wireless connection
	- Physical
		- Cables

Most important element in computer network is bandwidth.
