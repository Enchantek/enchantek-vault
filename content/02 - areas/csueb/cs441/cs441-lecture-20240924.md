- ### Compression
- #### Lossless vs Lossy
- Compression is another technique to squeeze more data over a communications line.
- If you can compress a data file down to one half of it’s original size, file will obviously transfer in less time
- **Lossless**: when data is uncompressed, original data returns
- **Lossy**: when data is uncompressed, you do not have the original data
- Lossy example: gray object on gray background, speed is optimized in video when the missing data is generated after video is uncompressed, doesn’t have to deal with every single pixel
- Preserves the bandwidth.
- Financial file: lossless is preferrable
- Video, image, movie, or audio: lossy is okay
- Lossless compression examples
	- Huffman codes
	- Run-length compression
	- Lempel-Ziv compression
- Lossy compression examples:
	- MPEG
	- JPEG
	- MP3
- ### Error Correction
- (On midterm)
- **Noise** is always present
- If you had goggles to see electromagnetic waves you’d be able to see a lot of it
- If a communications line experiences too much noise, the signal will be lost or corrupted
	- Enemy of electrical engineers is noise
	- Mechanical engineers is vibrations
- Communications systems should check for transmission errors
- Once an error is detected, a system may perform some action
- Some systems perform no error control, but simply let the data in the error be discarded
- ### Types of Noise
- #### White noise
- Aka thermal or Gaussian noise
- Relatively constant and can be reduced
- If white noise gets too strong, it can be completely disrupt the signal

- #### Impulse noise
- One of the most disruptive forms of noise
- Random spikes of power can destroy one or more bits of information
- Difficult to remove from an analog signal because it may be hard to distinguish from the original signal
- Can damage more bits if the bits are closer together transmitted at a faster rate)

- #### Crosstalk
- Unwanted coupling between two different signal paths
	- Ex: hearing another conversation while talking on the telephone
- Relatively constant and can be reduced with proper measures
- #### Echo
- The reflective feedback of a transmitted signal as the signal moves through a medium
- Most often occurs on a **coaxial cable** – relates to **bus** topology, without terminators echo would occur at the end of the cable
- #### Jitter
- The result of small timing irregularities during the transmission of digital signals
- Occurs when a digital signal is repeated over and over
- If serious enough, jitter forces systems to slow down their transmission
- Steps can be taken to reduce jitter
- #### Delay Distortion
- Occurs because the velocity of propagation of a signal through a medium varies with the frequency of the signal
- Can be reduced
- #### Attenuation
- The continuous loss of a signal’s strength as it travels through a medium
- Why repeaters and boosters exist
- ### Error prevention
