- Packets are assembled together at the end despite the order they arrive in
- #### Network Hardware
- Makes network connectivity possible
	- Starts from **NIC** or Ethernet adapter
	- Network travels through hubs, switches, routers, and bridges (also physical units, talked about next unit)
- Efficient network design requires a thorough understanding of these devices and possible config options
- Hard to have problems with NICs because they are designed simply
- #### Repeaters and Hubs
	- Going from least intelligence to most intelligence
- **Repeaters**
	- Operate in Physical OSI model layer
	- No means to interpret data
	- Regenerate signal
- **Hub**
	- Repeater with more than one output port
	- Typically contains multiple data ports
- #### Bridges
- A connectivity devices that operates at Data Link layer (Layer 2)
- Reads header info to forward packets according to their MAC addresses
- #### Switches
- Two modes for switches
	- **store-and-forward mode**
		- Switch reads entire data frame into its memory and checks for accuracy before transmitting it
		- More time consuming but more accurate
	- **cut-through mode**
		- Switch reads frame’s header then decides where to forward the data before it receives the entire packet
		- Faster but less accurate
- A connectivity devices that logically subdivides a network into smaller, individual collision domains
- Operates at Data Link layer (layer 2)
- Everything done in one device: hub, bridge
- #### VLAN
	- Virtual Local Area Network
	- Local Area Network
	- Metro Area Network
	- Wide Area Network
	- Storage Area Network
	- Personal Area Network
	- Buddy Area Network
- VLAN – A network within a network that is logically defined by grouping it's devices’ switch ports in the same broadcast domain
- Advantages:
	- Flexibility
- #### Router
- Multiport device operates at Layer 3 of OSI model and uses logical addressing information to direct data between networks or segments
- Routers can connect dissimilar LANs and VLANs running at different transmission speeds using a variety of Network layer protocols
- Determines the best path between nodes (*OSPF*) based on traffic congestion, available versus unavailable routes, load balancing targets, and other factors
- Characteristics
	- Intelligence
		- Tracks node location
		- Determine shortest, fastest path between two nodes
		- Connects dissimilar network types
	- Large LANs and WANs
		- Routers indispensable
	- Router Components
		- Internal processor
		- Operating system
		- Memory
		- Input and output
		- Management control interface
- Capabilities
	- Connect dissimilar networks
	- Interpret Layer 3 addressing
	- Determine best data path
	- Reroute traffic
- Types of routers
	- Interior
	- Exterior
	- Border
