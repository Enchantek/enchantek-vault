- ### 10 myths of cloud computing
- #### 1) It is only for tech companies
- Any company is the horizontal and vertical markets can use it no matter what it is in size
- Dropbox, etc.
- #### 2) Security is the biggest risk
- Security measures used by well-known cloud vendors are often better than their clients
- The cloud vendors have the resources and skills to keep it up to date
- #### 3) Everything works better in the cloud
- Except old applications that were run on dedicated servers, often difficult to run on cloud
- #### 4) It is always cheaper to run on the cloud
- It’s not always cheaper but it can be more cost efficient
- Cloud works best for variable demands and workloads, where you have high demand at times but lower demand at others
- #### 5) Cloud is harmful to the environment
- No question that data centers consume huge amounts of energy
- But when businesses move from on-site facilities to consolidated cloud data centers, it saves energy and cuts pollution
- Microsoft’s 3 mile islands: nuclear plants
- Servers have their own dedicated energy centers
- Instead of multiple cars, it’s like using a bus
- #### 6) Cloud costs jobs
- It actually creates jobs
- By the end of 2020, cloud computing created more than 15 million jobs worldwide
- Required cloud-savvy experts who’s skills and knowledge will maintain and strengthen growth and development
- #### 7) Integrating into the Cloud is more hassle than it is worth
- IF you work in partnership with a trusted and experienced hosting provider it’s a seamlessly process
- It can all happen very quickly with minimal downtime
- #### 8) Cloud is not for mission-critical use
- Cloud computing computer can be used for all aspect of businesses including mission-critical applications for many reasons including less downtime, and auto backup
- #### 9) Cloud is virtualization
- Virtualization is software that manipulates hardware
- While cloud computing refers to a service that results from that manipulation
- Cloud computing is based on servicing virtualized machines
- #### 10) I’ll be caught by vendor “lock-in”
- This is true only to the same extend of on-premise, traditional software
- There would be nothing to stop businesses building their own applications and deal with more than one vendor
